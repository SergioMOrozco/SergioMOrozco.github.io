Hello! I am a graduate student at Brown University working under [George Konidaris]{https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/} and [Stefanie Tellex]{https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/people/}. I am currently exploring various state representations that allow agents to generate geometrically reasonable subgoals for long horizon tasks. I'm broadly interested in creating general autonomous agents.

My Promise To Ethical AI
======

Although AI and robotics can expedite tasks and ameliorate our lives, I cannot turn a blind eye in its ability to displace entire industries and amplify human bias. I personally promise to develop AI with a conscientious and egalitarian mindset, and I believed that ethically responsible AI should always be at the forefront of discussion.

Interests
======

Apart from research, I spend the majority of my time reading, execising, looking through my telescope, and playing my saxophone. If your're a student at Brown, I'm always open to connecting, whether it be for a round of golf, a quick game of Magic The Gathering, or going out for a beer!
