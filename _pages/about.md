Hello! I am a graduate student at Brown University working under George Konidaris and Stefanie Tellex. I am currently exploring various state representations that allow agents to generate geometrically reasonable subgoals for long horizon tasks. I'm broadly interested in creating general autonomous agents.

My Promise To Ethical AI
======

Although AI and robotics can expedite tasks and ameliorate our lives, I cannot turn a blind eye in its ability to displace entire industries and amplify human bias. I personally promise to develop AI with a conscientious and egalitarian mindset, and I believed that ethically responsible AI should always be at the forefront of discussion.
