I recently created a Machine Learning model from scratch that I used for a classification problem. Specifically, the model is a Softmax Classifier using Gradient Descent. My hope is that youâ€™ll follow along and use this article as a means to create and modify your own Softmax Classifier, as well as learn some of the theory behind the functions we are using.
